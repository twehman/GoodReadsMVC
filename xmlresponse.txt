The sky is clear, the waters calm, and the veneered, select guests jovial as the exclusive cruise ship, the Aurora, begins her voyage in the picturesque North Sea. At first, Lo's stay is nothing but pleasant: the cabins are plush, the dinner parties are sparkling, and the guests are elegant. But as the week wears on, frigid winds whip the deck, gray skies fall, and Lo witnesses what she can only describe as a dark and terrifying nightmare: a woman being thrown overboard. The problem? All passengers remain accounted for and so, the ship sails on as if nothing has happened, despite Lo's desperate attempts to convey that something (or someone) has gone terribly, terribly wrong.</description><authors><author><id>9013543</id><name>Ruth Ware</name><role></role><image_url nophoto='false'><![CDATA[https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1562697198p5/9013543.jpg]]></image_url><small_image_url nophoto='false'><![CDATA[https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1562697198p2/9013543.jpg]]></small_image_url><link><![CDATA[https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9013543.Ruth_Ware]]></link><average_rating>3.71</average_rating><ratings_count>752727</ratings_count><text_reviews_count>73093</text_reviews_count></author></authors>  <published>2016</published><work>  <id>48209164</id>  <uri>kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.qbKnsog926jI3Kac5Yn5fw</uri></work></book>    <book>  <id type="integer">27834600</id>  <isbn>1501112333</isbn>  <isbn13>9781501112331</isbn13>  <text_reviews_count type="integer">4679</text_reviews_count>  <uri>kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.SMz1eL5IUBhHsoygORgwZA</uri>  <title>In a Dark, Dark Wood</title>  <title_without_series>In a Dark, Dark Wood</title_without_series>  <image_url>https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1523543089l/27834600._SX98_.jpg</image_url>  <small_image_url>https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1523543089l/27834600._SY75_.jpg</small_image_url>  <large_image_url/>  <link>https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27834600-in-a-dark-dark-wood</link>  <num_pages>308</num_pages>  <format>Paperback</format>  <edition_information/>  <publisher>Gallery/Scout Press</publisher>  <publication_day>19</publication_day>  <publication_year>2016</publication_year>  <publication_month>4</publication_month>  <average_rating>3.69</average_rating>  <ratings_count>191115</ratings_count>  <description>&lt;i&gt;In a dark, dark wood&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nora hasn't seen Clare for ten years.

Before she can stop him, the dog charges into the water to retrieve what first appears to be a wayward stick, but to her horror, turns out to be something much more sinister...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning, three women in and around London—Fatima, Thea, and Isabel—receive the text they had always hoped would NEVER come, from the fourth in their formerly inseparable clique, Kate, that says only, “I need you.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The four girls were best friends at Salten, a second rate boarding school set near the cliffs of the English Channel. Each different in their own way, the four became inseparable and were notorious for playing the Lying Game, telling lies at every turn to both fellow boarders and faculty, with varying states of serious and flippant nature that were disturbing enough to ensure that everyone steered clear of them. The myriad and complicated rules of the game are strict: no lying to each other—ever. Bail on the lie when it becomes clear it is about to be found out. But their little game had consequences, and the girls were all expelled in their final year of school under mysterious circumstances surrounding the death of the school’s eccentric art teacher, Ambrose (who also happens to be Kate’s father).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Atmospheric, twisty, and with just the right amount of chill that will keep you wrong-footed—which has now become Ruth Ware’s signature style—&lt;i&gt;The Lying Game&lt;/i&gt; is sure to be her next big bestseller. Another unputdownable thriller from the Agatha Christie of our time.</description><authors><author><id>9013543</id><name>Ruth Ware</name><role></role><image_url nophoto='false'><![CDATA[https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1562697198p5/9013543.jpg]]></image_url><small_image_url nophoto='false'><![CDATA[https://images.gr-assets.com/authors/1562697198p2/9013543.jpg]]></small_image_url><link><![CDATA[https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/9013543.Ruth_Ware]]></link><average_rating>3.71</average_rating><ratings_count>752727</ratings_count><text_reviews_count>73093</text_reviews_count></author></authors>  <published>2017</published><work>  <id>52694768</id>  <uri>kca://work/amzn1.gr.work.v1.PImT28L4HC6bT2gNJyiTzQ</uri></work></book>    <book>  <id type="integer">42080142</id>  <isbn>1501188771</isbn>  <isbn13>9781501188770</isbn13>  <text_reviews_count type="integer">9082</text_reviews_count>  <uri>kca://book/amzn1.gr.book.v1.N8v4IRTxC5rFnvJL48I-dA</uri>  <title>The Turn of the Key</title>  <title_without_series>The Turn of the Key</title_without_series>  <image_url>https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1548204800l/42080142._SX98_.jpg</image_url>  <small_image_url>https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1548204800l/42080142._SY75_.jpg</small_image_url>  <large_image_url/>  <link>https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42080142-the-turn-of-the-key</link>  <num_pages>337</num_pages>  <format>Hardcover</format>  <edition_information/>  <publisher>Gallery/Scout Press</publisher>  <publication_day>6</publication_day>  <publication_year>2019</publication_year>  <publication_month>8</publication_month>  <average_rating>3.96</average_rating>  <ratings_count>73678</ratings_count>  <description>When she stumbles across the ad, she’s looking for something else completely. But it seems like too good an opportunity to miss—a live-in nannying post, with a staggeringly generous salary. And when Rowan Caine arrives at Heatherbrae House, she is smitten—by the luxurious “smart” home fitted out with all modern conveniences, by the beautiful Scottish Highlands, and by this picture-perfect family.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What she doesn’t know is that she’s stepping into a nightmare—one that will end with a child dead and herself in prison awaiting trial for murder.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Writing to her lawyer from prison, she struggles to explain the unravelling events that led to her incarceration. It wasn’t just the constant surveillance from the cameras installed around the house, or the malfunctioning technology that woke the household with booming music, or turned the lights off at the worst possible time. It wasn’t just the girls, who turned out to be a far cry from the immaculately behaved model children she met at her interview. It wasn’t even the way she was left alone for weeks at a time, with no adults around apart from the enigmatic handyman, Jack Grant.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was everything.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;She knows she’s made mistakes. She admits that she lied to obtain the post, and that her behavior toward the children wasn’t always ideal. She’s not innocent, by any means. But, she maintains, she’s not guilty—at least not of murder. Which means someone else is.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Full of spellbinding menace and told in Ruth Ware’s signature suspenseful style, &lt;i&gt;The Turn of the Key&lt;/i&gt; is an unputdownable thriller from the Agatha Christie of our time.</description><authors><author><id>9013543</id><name>Ruth Ware</name><role></role><image_url

FREE PREVIEW.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Harriet Westaway receives an unexpected letter telling her she’s inherited a substantial bequest from her Cornish grandmother, it seems like the answer to her prayers. She owes money to a loan shark and the threats are getting increasingly aggressive: she needs to get her hands on some cash fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There's just one problem - Hal's real grandparents died more than twenty years ago. The letter has been sent to the wrong person. But Hal knows that the cold-reading techniques she’s honed as a seaside fortune teller could help her con her way to getting the money. If anyone has the skills to turn up at a stranger's funeral and claim a bequest they’re not entitled to, it’s her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hal makes a choice that will change her life for ever. But once she embarks on her deception, there is no going back.
